# we will create components as package that'sway we have created init file inside components folder .
# data ingestion - It means we will reading dataset from any database or from any other file location . data ingestion is a part of module .
# data validation - After reading the data, we have to do data validation .
# data transformation - Transforming data is called data transformation . Here we will see how to change categorical features into numerical features . How to handle one-hot encoding and label encoding .
# model_trainer - Here we will specifically train our model . How many model we have to solve here . we will create confusion matrix if we want to solve classification problem here .

# components like data_ingestion,data_transformation,model_trainer are basically for training purpose .

# components are basically modules that we are going to use specifically in this  project .
